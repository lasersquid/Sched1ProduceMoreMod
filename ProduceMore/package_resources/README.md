# ProduceMore

Tired of waiting 8 hours for lab ovens? Is waiting 6 hours for cauldrons just too long? Configure the speed of almost every station in the game, and stack sizes too.

This mod is for anyone who wants to accelerate their production. Or if you like a more leisurely playthrough, you can also slow things down.


## Features

Supports modifying the speed of:

 - Chemistry station
 - Lab oven
 - Cauldron
 - Mixing station
 - Packaging station
 - Pot
 - Drying rack

Supports modifying the batch size of:

 - Mixing station
 - Drying rack

Supports modifying stack size of every item in the game by category, with overrides for individual items. This includes cash!


## Configuration

The configuration file is ProduceMoreSettings.json, and is generated in Schedule I's UserData directory when the mod is run for the first time. It can easily be edited by hand with any text editor (eg, Notepad). The default mod configuration is to use the same stack sizes and station speeds as the unaltered game.


## Compatibility

This mod is known to be incompatible with BetterStacks.
