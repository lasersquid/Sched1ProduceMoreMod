## Build Prerequisites:
* For IL2CPP (main) version: Check out main branch of Schedule I. Install MelonLoader for Schedule I and run the game at least once to generate assemblies in the game's "MelonLoader" directory.
* For Mono (alternate) version: Check out alternate branch of Schedule I. Assemblies will populate automatically in "Schedule I_data/Managed" directory.


## Build instructions:
1. Clone repo. Create directories "il2cpp_libs" and "mono_libs" inside OvensCookFaster directory.
2. Open solution in Visual Studio (I used v2022). Load regular csproj for the IL2CPP version, and mono csproj for the Mono version.
3. Install recommended NuGet packages (Project>Manage NuGet Packages).
4. For each missing dependency, copy required libraries to the respective *_libs directories.
	* For the IL2CPP libraries, copy DLLs from Schedule I's "MelonLoader/Il2CppAssemblies" and "MelonLoader/net6" directories to the il2cpp_libs directory.
	* For the Mono libraries, copy DLLs from Schedule I's "Schedule I_data/Managed" directory to the mono_libs directory.
	* Note: You must switch to the main branch for IL2CPP libraries to be generated by MelonLoader, and you must switch to the alternate branch for Mono libraries to be populated.
5. Build desired project(s). Project output will be in bin directory. Vortex packages will be in packages directory.


## Install instructions:
* Vortex (from Nexus Mods) (RECOMMENDED): Open Vortex Mod Manager, then, in a browser, navigate to [mod page](https://www.nexusmods.com/schedule1/mods/1028) and click "Vortex" download button, then select the appropriate version.
